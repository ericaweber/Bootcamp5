<!-- 
  Create a new view that uses a map to display all the listings with the angular-google-maps library. 
  Each listing should be displayed as a marker. Each marker, when clicked on, should display a window that 
  provides the name, code, and address of the listing. 

  Some useful documentation: 
    https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/google-map
    https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/markers
    https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/api/windows
  -->


<div class="row" ng-controller="ListingsController" ng-init="find()">
  <div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10">
    <!-- 
      If an error occurs while we try to save the listing using our server's API, it will show up here. 
      This is made possible by handling any errors by binding them to $scope.error. 

        <strong ng-bind="error"></strong> is similar to <strong>{{ error }}</strong>

      From the Angular docs: 
      "It is preferable to use ngBind instead of {{ expression }} if a template is momentarily displayed by the browser in its raw state before Angular compiles it. Since ngBind is an element attribute, it makes the bindings invisible to the user while the page is loading." (https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngBind)
